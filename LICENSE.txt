                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2026 KHITORI

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version,
on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the
source code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

  "Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a way
requiring copyright permission.

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making modifications.

  "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

1. Source Code.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code
and to modify the work.

2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all notices stating that this
License applies; and give all recipients a copy of this License.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program if you also meet all of
these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
       under this License.
    c) You must license the entire work under this License.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey object code provided that you also convey the
Corresponding Source.

13. Remote Network Interaction.

  If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently
offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network
an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version.

14. Revised Versions.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions of the
GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program:

    Copyright (C) 2026 KHITORI

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
